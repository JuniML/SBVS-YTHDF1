You will find herein the code and files related to our paper:


Muhammad Junaid, Bo Wang and Wenjin Li. Data augmentation helps to improves the performance of the scoring function in structured based virtual screening for m6A reader protein YTHDF1

We advise you to refer to our following Nature Protocols paper to better understand SBVS

Tran-Nguyen, V. K., Junaid, M., Simeon, S. & Ballester, P. J. A practical guide to machine-learning scoring for structure-based virtual screening. Nat. Protoc. (2023).

The protocol-env environment has to be set up before the notebooks are used: please find the protocol-env.yml file for this purpose in our MLSF-protocol github repository: https://github.com/vktrannguyen/MLSF-protocol.
